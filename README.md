# Short Description
H&B Fencing is an application to provide online quotes for fence projects for the end user.

# How It Works

# Client View
Users can visit the application and request a quote for their project.

 First they need to create an account, after they are logged in, They can begin the process of acquiring a quote.

They start entering their home address and choose how many sides
from their fence they need to install.

Then enter the information "Length in ft" on each side of the fence either the right side or the back side or any side of the fence.

And depending on what type of wood they want to use,  the price of the fence changes

They choose if they need a gate on either side of the fence and the width of the gate,  and if the gate is sigle gate or double gate
depending on what they choose, the price of each gate is reflected.

After entering the information for each side, they receive a quote with the price of each side.
so that they can show their neighbors the price of each side in case they decide to share the cost of the fence.

They have the option of accepting the quote and when accepting, the admin receives the quote in the admin account.
And the quote is stored in the database and displayed for the end user in their account in case you want to print the quote
